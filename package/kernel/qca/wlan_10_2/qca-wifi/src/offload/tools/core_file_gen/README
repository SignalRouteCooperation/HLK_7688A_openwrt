This program can be used to generate the EXT2 core file from a memory/register dump. The core file can then be loaded into gdb along with the appropiate symbol files to analyze the memory state of the chip.

For Peregrine
=============
1. Run the gen_peregrine_core_dump script on host of crashed machine. 
This will generate a "text" version of the core dump in /tmp/core.txt
(make sure that athdiag has been built and present in path)

2. Copy over the core.txt to build machine and generate core dump file
./core_file_gen core.txt   

3. Previous step generates a core file that can be loaded into gdb
gdb -c core

4. Loading symbol table of RAM and ROM will enable analyzing the memory of
the target. 
add-symbol-file sw.rom.out <load address>
add-symbol-file athwlan.out <load adddress>
